/**
 * By importing styles here, we ensure that the styles defined in
 * the SCSS file are included in our application.
 *
 * The import statement triggers Webpack to process the main scss file and
 * apply any necessary transformations or loaders configured in the Webpack
 * configuration. Webpack's module bundling capability allows us to import
 * stylesheets directly in our JavaScript code.
 *
 * During the build process, Webpack's loaders, such as 'sass-loader' and
 * 'css-loader', interpret and compile the SCSS code into valid CSS. The
 * resulting CSS is then injected into the application at runtime, allowing the
 * styles to be applied to the corresponding HTML elements.
