/**
 * This is the main SCSS stylesheet file where you can define and organize your styles for the application.
 *
 * The @use and @forward directives are used to import and manage SCSS modules and partials.
 *
 * - @use directive allows you to import and use functionality from other SCSS modules.
 *   It provides better encapsulation and avoids conflicting global CSS class names.
 *   Use it to import SCSS modules that contain reusable styles, mixins, variables, or functions.

 * - @forward directive allows you to re-export styles from one module to another.
 *   It acts as a bridge between different SCSS modules, making styles available for import in other files.
 *   Use it when you want to expose certain styles or functionality from one module to be used in another.
